## v11.3 — 2026-04-11

### Mobile UI
- Responsive layout throughout — status bar, nav, admin panel, character creation all adapt to small screens

- **@verb/@verbs**: comprehensive alphabetical listing of every game command with parameters
- **@go/@goplr**: broadcast entry/exit echoes using custom @entry/@exit text
- **@invis** GMs move completely silently (no echoes of any kind)

### Combat & Movement
- **ADVANCE <target>**: properly engages a monster or player in combat
- **RETREAT**: disengages from combat without fleeing the room
- **YELL heard in adjacent rooms**: "You hear someone yell..." through all exits
- **DEPART**: sends to City Gate (201) instead of tutorial room (3950)

### Multiplayer
- **Room arrival/departure on login/logout**: players in a room see "X arrives." when someone logs in and "X fades from the Realms." on logout

- **Fix @heal on live players**: GM commands now modify the live session player, not a stale DB copy

### Commands
- **Fix THINK preserving text**: was dropping the first word ("mmm..." in "think mmm... thesnia leaf"); now uses original input text with correct case
- **RECITE line breaks**: backslash (`\`) creates multi-line poetry/song output

### Security
- **Two-tier rate limiting**: 4 commands/sec burst + 10 commands per 10 seconds sustained
- **Max 8 characters per account**

## v10.0.3 — 2026-04-04

### Bot API (New Feature)
Bots were not part of the original game — this is a new feature added to help repopulate the world. Bots can't do anything a human player can't; they follow the same rules, rate limits, and game mechanics.

- **API key system**: generate per-character keys from the main menu (SHA-256 hashed, shown once)
- **WebSocket `auth_apikey`**: bots connect and authenticate via the same WebSocket as regular players
- **[Bot] marker** on WHO list so other players can see who's a bot
- **GM scope control**: GM bots can optionally be restricted from using GM commands
- **SDK examples**: Python, Node.js, and TypeScript in `/bots/` directory with full documentation

### Currency & Trading
- **GIVE money**: `GIVE 5 GOLD TO Taliesin`, `GIVE 10 SILVER TO player`, etc.
- **All currency types**: gold crowns, silver shillings, copper pennies
- **Regional currencies**: kragenmark, danir, shard, darktar, dollar (transferred as MONEY inventory items)
- Accepts plural forms and full names (crowns, shillings, pennies, etc.)

## v10.0.2 — 2026-04-04

### Script Engine
- **ELSE branches** in script conditionals now work (IFVAR, IFITEM, IFNOITEM, IFCARRY, IFFULLDESC, IFIN)
- **Case-insensitive file loading** for DOS-era script filenames — scans directory for matching files regardless of case
- **PORTAL_CLIMBUP, PORTAL_CLIMBDOWN, PORTAL_OVER** types added to parser (were silently falling back to MISC)
- **New script variables**: WARRANT, GFLAG1-4, NUMPLRS, ARENADEATH, SITTING, LAYING, STANDING, KNEELING, WIELDED, WEALTH, REGION

### GM Tools
- **@line1/2/3 [player] <text>** — set persistent description lines on any character, visible on EXAMINE
- **@entry/@exit <text>** — custom room entry/exit messages (replaces default "arrives"/"goes north")
- **@speech <player> <verb phrase>** — set custom speech patterns (e.g., "says grimly", "squawks", "giggle")
- **REPORT <message>** — player command to file reports (broadcast to all GMs, logged with "report" event type)
- **@help** updated with all new commands

### Security Hardening
- **Per-IP WebSocket connection limit** (5 max per IP, 500 total)
- **Command rate limiting** (10 commands/sec, then throttled)
- **Chat flood protection** (5 broadcast messages per 10 seconds)
- **HTML entity sanitization** on all outgoing messages (defense in depth against XSS)
- **REST API auth gates** — /api/characters GET and POST now require authentication
- **MongoDB regex injection fix** in resolvePlayerByName (regexp.QuoteMeta)
- **JWT lifetime reduced** from 30 days to 7 days
- **Dead player command restriction** — limited to DEPART, LOOK, WHO, QUIT, EXP, STATUS, HEALTH

### Fixes
- **Room 225 stairway** — PORTAL_CLIMBUP type was parsed as MISC, blocking GO STAIR
- **Temple of Amilor** — room 592 missing due to AMILOR.SCR case mismatch in git; ELSE branches not firing
- **SKILLS command** — was hardcoded to "no skills yet", now shows actual trained skills
- **Grammar fixes** — "A a fist" → proper article, "your an axe" → "your axe", natural weapons don't drop
- **SPEECH** — removed as player command, now GM-only via @speech

## v10.0.1 — 2026-04-04

### Character Management
- **Soft-delete characters** from main menu with confirmation modal
- **Unique first names** enforced on character creation
- **Admin character recovery**: browse deleted characters, recover with optional rename if name conflicts
- **Name validation split**: monster/game names blocked as exact match only; slurs blocked as substring
- Removed over-aggressive substring matching (e.g., "Pendragon" no longer blocked for containing "dragon")

### Script Engine Variables
- **WARRANT**: player warrant level for law/crime system
- **GFLAG1-4**: global flags accessible in scripts

- **ARENADEATH**: whether player died in arena
- **SITTING, LAYING, STANDING, KNEELING**: position state variables

- **Fixed Taliesin login**: reserved-word validation was running on login, not just creation — "Pendragon" was blocked because it contains "dragon"
- **Name validation moved to creation only** — existing characters log in without name checks
- **Version notes deeplink**: /version-notes URL works as direct link

### Infrastructure
- **Engine test harness**: first unit test (TestLoadPlayerTaliesin) verifying MongoDB player lookup
- **Warrant field** added to Player struct for future law system

## v10.0.0 — 2026-04-04
